Hi, I am glad to help you build up your website.

Here are some possible project types, and feel free to discuss any other ideas as well:

- WordPress setup
- Interactive event websites
- Event voting websites
- Custom static websites (no backend, no database)

In general, handling projects that are not as complex as e-commerce websites should not be a problem for me. I can also assist with domain and server hosting arrangements.

Some of the features I have implemented in previous projects include:
- Membership systems
- Integration with LINE Login API
- File upload functionality (images/videos)
- Survey forms
- Admin dashboards
- Image & Video watermarking service
- Data visualization
- API integration / implement
