  "content": "\n<p>Today I am releasing version 2.0.1 for Tab Notes on both Firefox and Chrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-TW/firefox/addon/tab-notes/\">https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-TW/firefox/addon/tab-notes/</a></li><li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-notes/obnnegakmgonaiplaobihpmcjhlceeic\">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-notes/obnnegakmgonaiplaobihpmcjhlceeic</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I have added a new for this version: Multi-notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>New Feature: Multi-notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://blog.wildsky.cc/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-22.01.03-e1564669968766.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1456\" srcset=\"https://backend.wildsky.cc/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-22.01.03-e1564669968766.png 700w, https://backend.wildsky.cc/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-22.01.03-e1564669968766-300x167.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Never have too many notes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You could create new note when there current note is not empty</strong>. The reason why I make this rule is to avoid too many useless notes in side bar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might said: &#8220;Why not add an delete button?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm, I want this add-on simple and have as less  control item as possible. Adding too many buttons will make this add-on too complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Never mistakenly delete your notes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and there are other rule: The create button will become delete button when both two statement is true.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You have more than one notes.</li><li>The current note is empty.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This design will avoid you from mistakenly deleting your important notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automatically find empty note</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, I don&#8217;t want users to have too many notes. Therefore, I made some magic onto the create button. When user have any empty note in the list, Tab Notes will automatically switch to it once you click the create button.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use it like before</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important, some users might not need this multi-note feature. And I don&#8217;t want to interfere them. So, I made this feature hide into an icon on the top-left icon. If you don&#8217;t click it, you will never found this new feature. You could use Tab Note like before, open, write, and close. Nothing is different!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Next Step</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While I was developing this new feature, there are so many to-do items in my brain. Such as re-order notes, export/import, and create/update time (for sorting).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use a brand new logic to write this add-on: single source of truth, render will fire while user do anything. Because I don&#8217;t use any framework or 3rd party JavaScript library, it might causing some performance issue. This might be the most important thing I should do in the next minor version.</p>\n"
