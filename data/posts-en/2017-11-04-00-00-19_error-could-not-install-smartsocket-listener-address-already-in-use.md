This article is about error message: ‚Äúerror: could not install smartsocket listener: Address already in use‚Äù.

I like to flash my android smartphone. As we all know, there are (at lease) two tools we could use when flashing phones: `adb` and `fastboot`. But I met a problem when I try to run new adb server, it keep showing the this message in my terminal:

The Message ‚Äúerror: could not install smartsocket listener: Address already in use‚Äù
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúAddress already in use? so there must be someone using the address I need.‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúok, let me find the criminal‚Äù

and I gave terminal a command `ps aux | grep adb` to show all processes which is including adb word, then I got:

    wildsky   7456  0.1  0.0   9988  1916 ?        Ss   20:43   0:01 /home/wildsky/Desktop/FlashTool/x10flasher_lib/adb.linux.64 status-window
    wildsky   7459  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    20:43   0:00 [adb.linux.64] <defunct>
    wildsky   7499  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    20:43   0:00 [adb.linux.64] <defunct>
    # ... there might be lots of defunct, just dismiss it.
    wildsky   9752  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    20:56   0:00 [adb.linux.64] <defunct>
    wildsky   9842  0.0  0.0 173840  2008 ?        Sl   20:57   0:00 adb -P 5037 fork-server server
    wildsky  10705  0.0  0.0 119456   984 pts/1    S+   21:00   0:00 grep --color=auto adb

If I kill 9842 (adb -P 5037 fork-server server), it will become `<defunct>`, and create anthor `adb -P 5037 fork-server server`, which means if I just delete the surface progress, the criminal behind the scenes will still alive. In another words: I can‚Äôt kill adb server forever‚Ä¶

![I already kill you but you still live. What's wrong with you, adb server?](/images/kyle-simmons-74218-unsplash-e1553233521391.jpg)

However, I notice that there are two kinds of progress about adb: `adb.linux.64` & `adb -P 5037 fork-server server`

just simply kill the first one, `adb.linux.64` , via this command:

    kill 7456

then kill `adb -P 5037 fork-server server` via:

    kill 9842

and then problem solved! Now I could create adb server without showing any error message.

Why I write this article
------------------------

I found there is no article about this problem, but there are some people facing this problem. And also, I used to meet this problem before, but it still take me some time to find the final problem.

So I decide to write down this problem, and copy the error message ‚Äúerror: could not install smartsocket listener: Address already in use‚Äù. Hope people who search this sentence could find this article, and they could save time from it. üôÇ
