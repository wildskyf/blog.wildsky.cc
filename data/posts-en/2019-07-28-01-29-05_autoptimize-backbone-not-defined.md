Although this just appear when user is logged in, we might be unhappy when seeing this.

To solve this problem, we could exclude Backbone.js and underscore.js from autoptimize.

We could add `, backbone.min.js, underscore.min.js` into `Exclude scripts from Autoptimize`. It is under `Admin Sidenav > Setting > Autoptimize > JS, CSS & HTML > JavaScript Options`.

Admin Sidenav > Setting > Autoptimize

And thatâ€™s it! Enjoy your clean console. ðŸ™‚
